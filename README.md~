#seqProfiler

seqProfiler is a toy Scalding application for my learning of Scalding, and for the analysis of sequence distributions in biological sequence data.  

More about Scalding<http://github.com/twitter/scalding>:

"Scalding is a Scala library that makes it easy to write MapReduce jobs in Hadoop. Instead of forcing you to write raw map and reduce functions, Scalding allows you to write code that looks like *natural* Scala. It's similar to other MapReduce platforms like Pig, but offers a more powerful level of abstraction due to its built-in integration with Scala and the JVM.

Scalding is built on top of [Cascading](http://www.cascading.org/), a Java library that abstracts away much of the complexity of Hadoop.
